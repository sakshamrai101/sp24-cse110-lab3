                <h3>Team Name Brainstorming</h3>
                <p>Initial suggestion to name the team "Subway Surfers" due to meeting location. Decided on "Software
                    Surfers" to keep the subway theme while making it more relevant to our focus.</p>

                <p>Gathered with the help of strangers to take a team bonding picture. Several formats for the intro
                    video were discussed. Concluded with a decision on a simple and elegant format for the intro video.
